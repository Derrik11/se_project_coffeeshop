# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

This project has taught me a lot, and excited to move forward. Even though I do not understand every command, the more I work on these projects every day the more I understand. If i can add more styles and animations I would.
